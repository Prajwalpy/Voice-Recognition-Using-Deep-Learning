## Gender Recognition by VoiceProject 

## Overview
This project implements a gender recognition system based on voice recordings. It uses Librosa for feature extraction and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. The system can predict whether a speaker is male or female based on their speech characteristics.

## Features
- Voice Data Processing: Loads and processes .wav files from the dataset.
- nFeature Extraction: Uses MFCC, pitch estimation, and zero-crossing rate.
- Machine Learning Model: Trains an SVM classifier to predict gender.
- Scalability: Can be extended to deep learning models (CNNs, LSTMs, or transformers).

## Future Work
- Implement deep learning models for better accuracy.
- Integrate real-time gender recognition.
- Use pretrained models like Wav2Vec2 or Whisper.
